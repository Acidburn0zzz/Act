=head1 JavaScript support

Act provides optional JavaScript support using the JQuery open source library.
It is enabled in your conference's C<ui> template:

  <script src="/js/jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="/js/act.js"></script>

When enabled, some Act features will take advantage of JQuery's Ajax support
to provide an enhanced user experience by eliminating page reloads or explicit
change submission.
