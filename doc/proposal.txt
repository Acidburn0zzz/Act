Project Title
  Integrating the TPF online payment system with Act

Synopsis
  Act (A Conference Toolkit, http://act.mongueurs.net/) is a framework
  designed to host multiple conferences, with a Perl bias.

  It currently only support payment with the YAPC Europe Foundation
  online payment system. The goal of this proposal is to integrate
  the TPF online payment system to Act, so as to facilitate the
  organisation of american Perl conferences using Act.

Benefits to the Perl Community
  American YAPCs and Perl workshop could benefit from the system
  already used by several european conferences.

  system. (We can work on fixing this.)"

  This is exactly what we are proposing.
