=head1 THE FULL LIST OF ALL ACT TEMPLATES

This page documents B<all> templates used within the Act framework.

All templates listed here exist in Act. If you add template files to
your conference F<templates/> directory, they will override the default
Act templates.

=head1 TEMPLATES YOU SHOULD MODIFY

=head2 User Interface

These templates define the look of your conference.

=over 4

=item * B<F<ui>>

This template is used as a WRAPPER for all pages generated by the Act
handlers. You should also use it to wrap your "static" pages.

=item * B<F<menu>>

=item * B<F<menus/item>>

=item * B<F<menus/section>>

=item * B<F<error_ui>>

This template defines the look of the error messages within Act.
You probably should simply add an C<error> class to your CSS.

    <span class="error">[% content %]</span>
    <br />

=head1 TEMPLATES YOU MAY WANT TO MODIFY

Many templates actually include other templates that contain the actual
Act logic. You may want to add specific information to them.

=item * B<F<talk/schedule>>

This is the main schedule template. Change it if you want to add information
around the schedule table. See L<http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2003/>
for an example.
