UNPRIORITIZED TODO LIST

* let the organizers force the registration of existing users
  (useful for speakers who can't be bothered to use the site,
  but will give a talk)

* the payments page should let the one create a new user, register it
  and add a payment (and use the code for finding duplicate users)
  (useful for on site registration during the conference)

* convert the whole application to UTF8

* replace Act::Form by Data::FormValidator

* list and document all the templates in the application

* divide the template content between structural information needed
  by the application (e.g. creation of the schedule, application
  forms) and presentation information which should be overridable by
  conference-specific templates

* define a set of coherent CSS styles for the application templates,
  so that conference organizers may easily override the application
  look and feel, and integrate it into their web site

* define a procedure (and possibly write some helper scripts) to
  manage the text modifications. When someone changes some text
  in the templates, the may be able to translate it at best in
  one or two other languages. Other translators need to be
  informed of the changes.

* track management: organizers should be able to create tracks for
  their conference, speakers should be able to select a track for their talk

* talk languages: define a set of accepted languages for a conference
  and let the speakers set the talk language

* talk target audience: beginner, intermediate, advanced.

* attendees: if a registered user doesn't show up, how is s/he counted?
  should there be a way for the organisers to mark the attendees as
  present? When a conference is over, treasurer/orga should be able to
  unregister participants who didn't show up.

* password modification page

* a website for managing one's profile outside any conference

* some statistics for the organizers
  - T-shirts stats:
    select count(*), tshirt_size from participations where conf_id=? group by tshirt_size;
  - family stats:
    select sum(nb_family) from participations where conf_id=?

* remove duplicate users from the database. this is an administrative task 
  which requires contacting users and asking which of their many logins
  to keep

* problem with empty fields: they are not updated
  see: stay pseudonymous, remove company

* B<current rights:> orga, treasurer, admin, staff, invited (no rights attached).
  
  better organisation: users, talks, orders, rights (i.e. attached to the
  various things that Act can manage)
  
  nowhere in the code should there be an "or" checking of rights
  (like is_staff || is_orga): if some user needs to see such and
  such parts of the site, they need the appropriate right
  
  B<new rights:>
  
  rights: rights management (= current 'admin' right)
  
  users: users management (= part of current 'orga' right), should only
  manage user registration, edition, etc
  
  talks: talks management (= part of currnet 'orga' right), should only
  manage talks acceptation, edition, schedule
  
  orders: orders management (= current 'treasurer' right)

* 'staff' and 'invited' are not rights giving access to special function
  within Act, but rather "tags" on some users, relative to a specific
  conference

* most tables should be sortable by clicking on column headers.
  => by default, sort the user search results by registration date, not
     by user_id

* rights management
  + show rights in table format, users as lines, rights as columns,
    with checkboxes to grant rights, and a listbox to add a new user.
    - pro: everything is controlled through a single form (granting
      and removing rights), better per user vision.
    - against: the list of rights must be supplied
      (at worse: select distinct right_id from rights should do it)

* photo gallery? Links with Flickr? tags? links with talks? author?

* image resizing
  => domm has posted code to the list: Message-ID: <20070115120018.GA2301@domm2.zsi.at>

* usefulness of global rights?

* more tests, especially for the web interface

* may a user have a different photograph every year?

* change the "orga" right name

* think about the user preferred language as a preference list:
  - ye2005,  pt => list = pt
  - fpw2005, fr => list = fr,pt
  - ipw2005, en => list = en,fr,pt
  at that point, we need to reconfigure the prefered language for
  the two other sites
  Another option is to add a lang field in participations, to have
  a favorite language per conference

* global user stats (top attendee, top speaker, etc)

* user-configurable searchlimit

* support for several monger groups (addition, search)

* PDF immutable invoices

* replace Act::Object with a more trendy ORM

* create a eg/ directory with at least two example conferences

* support for per conference options, like
  - register the hotel (e.g. european hackathon 2007)
  - vegeratian food

* hackathons do not have talks. Support that by disabling the talks
  related handlers.

* allow a conference to put a limit on the number of "paying" attendees
  => it may actually need to be a limit to "committed" attendes, since
     speakers often have the entrance fee waived

* handle the edition of lightning talk sessions, by creating something
  less burdensome than the current talk:id 

* shouldn't the tshirt size at user creation not be shown when the
  conference doesn't include a T-shirt?

* should the tshirt size be 'per conference'? (but copied from the
  info stored in the users base)

* Special Needs Support in a Flexible Way
  Registration should be able to accept information for many different things
  like the need of special meals, t-shirts size, special needs for
  accommodation and the like.  Registration for a specific event shouldn't
  include information which is irrelevant to that event.

* Closing Date
  It should be possible to close registrations before the event start date.

* Change Password Mechanism
  There should be a way to change passwords.

* Save Cookies
  It should be possible for the user to click a 'remember me' checkbox when
  logging in, so that the cookie will be retained.  I do not like having to log
  in each time I reopen my browser.  

* User Identification
  The login page asks for "User Identification", and this is not really clear.
  It's difficult to say what is the "user identification" needed. Maybe the
  text could be a bit more specific.

* Tracking Suspicious Users
  There should be a way to track down, mark out and pay attention on
  /suspicious/ users, in special those that doesn't register properly or aren't
  known or findable. Those registrations cause a lot of trouble, making
  organizers to waste time and resources with room reservations, special meals
  and other resources for people that will never show up.

* Admin Statistics
  Admins and organizers should be able to have some statistics and accounting
  for his/her personal use. Simple things like "how many people will be present
  to the event?" or "how many of those people have special needs - special
  meals, special accommodations?" or "how many people are staying on the hotel
  we booked and how many aren't?" should do the trick.

* Optional SSL Protected Admin Login
  There should be an optional SSL protected login option, at least for admins,
  allowing them to login to the website without being evasedropped.

* Provide RSS Feeds to inform people interested on the projects.

* Make it clear how to register for an event.

* Ensure users get clear and meaningful error messages when they get wrong
  passwords or aren't registered in the system.
