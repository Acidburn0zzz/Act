PRIORITIZED TODO LIST

* sponsor donation: allow for donation from non registered users;

* attendees should be able to pick one day out of the N days when they
  participate

* password modification page

* talk languages: define a set of accepted languages for a conference
  and let the speakers set the talk language

* corporate registration: register n people from same company in one shot.

UNPRIORITIZED TODO LIST

* let the organizers force the registration of existing users
  (useful for speakers who can't be bothered to use the site,
  but will give a talk)

* the payments page should let the one create a new user, register it
  and add a payment (and use the code for finding duplicate users)
  (useful for on site registration during the conference)

* define a set of coherent CSS styles for the application templates,
  so that conference organizers may easily override the application
  look and feel, and integrate it into their web site

* attendees: if a registered user doesn't show up, how is s/he counted?
  should there be a way for the organisers to mark the attendees as
  present? When a conference is over, treasurer/orga should be able to
  unregister participants who didn't show up.

* some statistics for the organizers
  - T-shirts stats:
    select count(*), tshirt_size from participations where conf_id=? group by tshirt_size;
  - family stats:
    select sum(nb_family) from participations where conf_id=?

* remove duplicate users from the database. this is an administrative task 
  which requires contacting users and asking which of their many logins
  to keep

* B<current rights:> orga, treasurer, admin, staff.
  
  better organisation: users, talks, orders, rights (i.e. attached to the
  various things that Act can manage)
  
  nowhere in the code should there be an "or" checking of rights
  (like is_staff || is_orga): if some user needs to see such and
  such parts of the site, they need the appropriate right
  
  B<new rights:>
  
  rights: rights management (= current 'admin' right)
  
  users: users management (= part of current 'orga' right), should only
  manage user registration, edition, etc
  
  talks: talks management (= part of currnet 'orga' right), should only
  manage talks acceptation, edition, schedule
  
  orders: orders management (= current 'treasurer' right)

* most tables should be sortable by clicking on column headers.
  => by default, sort the user search results by registration date, not
     by user_id

* photo gallery? Links with Flickr? tags? links with talks? author?

* more tests, especially for the web interface

* may a user have a different photograph every year?

* global user stats (top attendee, top speaker, etc)

* user-configurable searchlimit

* support for several monger groups (addition, search)

* PDF immutable invoices

* create a eg/ directory with at least two example conferences

* support for per conference options, like
  - register the hotel (e.g. european hackathon 2007)
  - vegetarian food

* hackathons do not have talks. Support that by disabling the talks
  related handlers.

* allow a conference to put a limit on the number of "paying" attendees
  => it may actually need to be a limit to "committed" attendes, since
     speakers often have the entrance fee waived

* handle the edition of lightning talk sessions, by creating something
  less burdensome than the current talk:id 

* shouldn't the tshirt size at user creation not be shown when the
  conference doesn't include a T-shirt?

* should the tshirt size be 'per conference'? (but copied from the
  info stored in the users base)

* Special Needs Support in a Flexible Way
  Registration should be able to accept information for many different things
  like the need of special meals, t-shirts size, special needs for
  accommodation and the like.  Registration for a specific event shouldn't
  include information which is irrelevant to that event.

* Closing Date
  It should be possible to close registrations before the event start date.

* Optional SSL Protected Admin Login
  There should be an optional SSL protected login option, at least for admins,
  allowing them to login to the website without being evasedropped.

* Make it clear how to register for an event.
    => register for an event?

* replace Act::Form by Data::FormValidator
    => maybe. Act::Form seems to work well now.

* replace Act::Object with a more trendy ORM

* User Identification
  The login page asks for "User Identification", and this is not really clear.
  It's difficult to say what is the "user identification" needed. Maybe the
  text could be a bit more specific.
    => Maybe. Does anyone really has trouble understanding the login form?

* Tracking Suspicious Users
  There should be a way to track down, mark out and pay attention on
  /suspicious/ users, in special those that doesn't register properly or aren't
  known or findable. Those registrations cause a lot of trouble, making
  organizers to waste time and resources with room reservations, special meals
  and other resources for people that will never show up.
    => the above definition of /suspicious/ seems pretty vague.

* think about the user preferred language as a preference list:
  - ye2005,  pt => list = pt
  - fpw2005, fr => list = fr,pt
  - ipw2005, en => list = en,fr,pt
  at that point, we need to reconfigure the prefered language for
  the two other sites
  Another option is to add a lang field in participations, to have
  a favorite language per conference
    => overkill

* a website for managing one's profile outside any conference
    => overkill
