<h2>Character formatting</h2>
<ul>
 <li>An item wrapped in three single quotes is <b>strong</b>.
 <li>An item wrapped in two single quotes is <i>emphasized</i>.
 <li>Any word with multiple CapitalLetters (e. g., StudlyCaps) will become a link.
</ul>
<h2>Paragraph formatting</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
 <li>Four or more hyphen characters at the start of a line create a horizontal line.
 <li>Newlines turn into the appropriate tags.
 <li>Headers are matching equals signs around the header text -- the more signs, the lesser the header.
</ul>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Lists are indented text, by one tab or four spaces by default.
 <li>In unordered lists, where each item has its own bullet point, each item needs a leading asterisk and space.
 <li>Ordered lists consist of items marked with combination of one or more alphanumeric characters followed by a period and an optional space.
 <li>Lists can be nested.
</ul>
<h2>Code</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Any indented text without either marking is code, handled literally. You can nest lists.
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>

The following is valid Wiki formatting, with an extended link as marked.
<pre>

        = my interesting text =

        NormalLink
        [AnExtendedLink|let the Sun shine]

        == my interesting lists ==

            * unordered one
            * unordered two

            1. ordered one
            2. ordered two
                        a. nested one
                        b. nested two

            code one
            code two

        The first line of a normal paragraph.
        The second line of a normal paragraph.  Whee.
</pre>
