README file for the Act tests

* Helper modules

Act can test itself with touching the production database.
Add the following configuration items to [database]:
    test_dsn
    test_user
    test_passwd

The t/Utils.pm file (use t::Utils in some test files)
connect the request object to the test database and clean up all
tables after each test suite.

* Test categories

The tests are prefixed with a number, which indicates several categories:

0x - Basic tests
     t/00test.t      - test if Test::More is here
     t/01cpan.t      - test for the CPAN modules we need
     t/02act.t       - try to require the Act::* modules
     t/02config.t    - test Act::Config
     t/03database.t  - try to connect to the database
     t/04template.t  - test Act::Template
     t/05util.t      - test Act::Util

1x - Core Act classes
     t/10user.t      - Act::User

Some test are not numbered, because the order of tests is unimportant,
once the numbered tests pass.

     t/form.t        - test Act::Form
