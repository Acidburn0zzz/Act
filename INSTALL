Installing Act on your system
-----------------------------

Install (or cvs checkout) Act in a directory. In this document we'll
use /home/act, and refer to it as Act's home directory.

First thing is to enable Perl (and mod_perl) to find the Act modules
and to map Act::Foo to /home/act/lib/Foo.pm.

    mkdir ~/lib; ln -s /home/act/lib lib/Act; export PERL5LIB=~/lib

Act needs to know its home directory so that it can find its
config file. This is done by setting the ACTHOME environment variable:

    export ACTHOME=/home/act

Make sure both ACTHOME and PERL5LIB are set and exported when
running httpd or 'make test'.

Next, define a virtual host in your Apache configuration file
(httpd.conf) for Act. Here's an example:

    <VirtualHost *>
      ServerName   localhost
      ServerAdmin  webmaster@example.com
      DocumentRoot /home/act/wwwdocs
      Include      /home/act/conf/httpd.conf
    </VirtualHost>

For code development it is useful to install the Apache::Reload
module. Enable it in httpd.conf (outside of any VirtualHost
containers):

    PerlModule Apache::Reload
    PerlInitHandler Apache::Reload
    PerlSetVar ReloadAll Off

Then and add this inside Act's VirtualHost container:

    PerlSetVar ReloadModules "Act::*"

If you don't want to mess with name-based virtual hosts and DNS,
an easy setup is to use a port-based virtual host:

    Listen 9000
    <VirtualHost *:9000>
      Port 9000
      ServerName   localhost
      ServerAdmin  webmaster@example.com
      DocumentRoot /home/act/wwwdocs
      Include      /home/act/conf/httpd.conf
    </VirtualHost>

Next, create a local configuration file in $ACTHOME/conf/local.ini.
This file is not part of the distribution: its contents override
the global settings in $ACTHOME/conf/act.ini. If you have no need
to override these standard settings, just create an empty file.

You are now ready to install and configure the database system.
See the details in database/INSTALL.<db> (where <db> is one of
Pg, MySQL...).

In the end, you must have the following section in your conf/act.ini
or conf/local.ini file:

    [database]
    dsn    = <dsn>
    user   = <db user>
    passwd = <db password>

To make sure that your system has all the requirements to run Act,
and that Act works correctly on it, you can now run Act's test suite:

    cd $ACTHOME
    make test
