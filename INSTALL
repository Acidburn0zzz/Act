Install (or cvs checkout) Act in a directory. In this document we'll
use /home/act, and refer to it as Act's home directory.

First thing is to enable Perl (and mod_perl) to find the Act modules
and to map Act::Foo to /home/act/lib/Foo.pm.

mkdir ~/lib; ln -s .../conferences/lib Act; export PERL5LIB=~/lib

Act needs to know its home directory so that it can find its
config file. This is done by setting the ACTHOME environment variable:

export ACTHOME=/home/act

Make sure both ACTHOME and PERL5LIB are set and exported when
running httpd.

Next, define a virtual host in your Apache configuration file
(httpd.conf) for Act. Here's an example:

<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName   localhost
  ServerAdmin  webmaster@example.com
  DocumentRoot /home/act/wwwdocs
  Include      /home/act/conf/httpd.conf
</VirtualHost>

For code development it is useful to install the Apache::Reload
modules, and add this to the above VirtualHost directives:

  PerlSetVar ReloadModules "Act::*"
